The IVUZE web proposal aims to address the challenges faced by the healthcare sector in Rwanda, particularly in accessing specialist consultations and medical services. IVUZE is a website designed to streamline hospital operations and enhance patient care experiences. By automating resource allocation, optimising service availability, and minimising specialist scheduling conflicts, IVUZE aims to reduce patient waiting times and improve resource utilisation. The proposal outlines the research objectives, the proposed solution, and a tentative work plan for developing and evaluating IVUZE.
